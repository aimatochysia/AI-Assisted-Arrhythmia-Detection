## Basic Guidance
![[Pasted image 20250419151523.png]]


## How it works:
### type 1
![[Pasted image 20250419151710.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250419151719.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250419151726.png]]

### type 2
![[Pasted image 20250419151749.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250419151800.png]]

### Basic Positioning
Signal moves from right arm to left leg vector
![[Pasted image 20250419151828.png]]
### Right to left movement
![[Pasted image 20250419151947.png]]

### movement II and movement III
Right leg set as ground
Right arm to left arm set as movement I
Right arm to left leg set as movement II
Left arm to left leg set as movement III
![[Pasted image 20250419152045.png]]

### AVL, AVR, AVF
AVL(Augemnted Lead) is when sum(Right Arm + Left Leg) compared to Left arm
AVR is when (left arm + left leg) compared to right arm
AVF is when (left arm + right arm) compared to left leg

### complete electrode circle placement
![[Pasted image 20250419161238.png]]
### example for ECG (movement I, II, III, AVL, AVR, AVF)
AVL is small because its perpendicular to the movement of the biosignal, movement II is large because it is parallel with the biosignal movement

### v1 - v6 placement corresponding to the biosignal

## Nodes
SA Nodes: heart's primary pacemaker (origin) 60-100bpm
AV Nodes: hearts' gatekeeper (slowing signal to let atria finishes contracting before contracting ventricle). Also backup pacemaker at 40-60bpm

# Arrhytmia
arrhythmia is the irregularities on heart rate be it irregular movement, fast slow unusual speed, or bump in ECG that shouldn't happened, most  can be detected via ECG, and that's why the focus of the thesis is ECG based. The focus will be on detecting arrhythmia not by knowing each type of arrhythmia based on ECG, but the opposite to maximally detect a healthy heartbeat and finding where thing isnt on where they should be.

## Arrhythmia determination

## Example of arrhythmia

### Sinus Arrhythmia

![[Pasted image 20250419154222.png]]
6 seconds diagram (2 lines)

![[Pasted image 20250419154546.png]]
SA node circled + 6 beats = 60bpm

#### Sign of the sinus arrhythmia
![[Pasted image 20250419154649.png]]
inconsistent beat = sinus arrhythmia (but often benign)

### Premature Atrial Complex
![[Pasted image 20250419154828.png]]
sooner than normal beat

#### Signs of the PAC arrhythmia:
![[Pasted image 20250419155008.png]]


### Premature Junctional Complex
![[Pasted image 20250419155315.png]]

#### Signs of PJC arrhythmia
![[Pasted image 20250419155419.png]]


### Premature Ventricular Complex
![[Pasted image 20250419155451.png]]

#### Signs of PVC arrhythmia
![[Pasted image 20250419155553.png]]
not started by SA node, instead using the backup AV node


### Sinus Bradycardia (Slow heartbeat)
![[Pasted image 20250419155700.png]]
40BPM (4 beat per 6 seconds)
#### Signs of Sinus Bradycardia
![[Pasted image 20250419155755.png]]
can be normal for athletes, usage of betablockers medication, old age weak heart

### Sinus Tachycardia (sped up heart rate)
![[Pasted image 20250419160011.png]]
14 / 6 seconds = 140 bpm
#### Signs of Sinus Tachycardia
![[Pasted image 20250419160053.png]]

### Supraventicular Tachycardia
![[Pasted image 20250419160249.png]]
150bpm

#### Signs of SVT
![[Pasted image 20250419160446.png]]
difference between SVT and Sinus Tachycardia = undistinguisable T or P signal, but regular beat
